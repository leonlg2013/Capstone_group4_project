# Capstone_group4_project
Carbon capture project for Capstone 
Carbon capture AI based solution.
Summary: 
The project entails finding a AI solution to the problem of carbon capture in the oil and gas field. We are going to focus on building a supply chain model that deals with the whole life cycle of carbon capture in an oil and gas production. From when carbon dioxide is first produced to building a place where people can buy and sell carbon credits in the web.

Background: 
The problem of underdeveloped Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies limits their effectiveness in mitigating climate change. Additionally, carbon offsets, while widely adopted, face scrutiny over their standards, techniques, and overall impact.
This affects companies in heavy industries, governments, regulatory bodies, environmental agencies, investors in carbon markets, and society at large, particularly in regions highly affected by climate change.
For companies, the uncertainty in CCUS and carbon offset standards raises the risk of non-compliance and financial losses. Governments and regulatory bodies struggle to implement consistent, effective policies. 
For companies, a detailed evaluation of CCUS and carbon credit feasibility will enable them to adopt technologies that meet their decarbonization goals cost-effectively. Governments can use the findings to shape more accurate and enforceable climate policies. 
Investors would gain more confidence in the carbon markets, leading to increased
funding for CCUS projects. Society would benefit from a clearer, more actionable path toward reducing carbon emissions, which is essential to mitigate climate change impacts.

Objective: 
Implement an AI solution that establishes a frame work to enhance carbon capture in oil and gas process.
1. Optimal quantification - properly quantize the carbon footprint from an oil production.
2. Machine Learning-based optimization of carbon capture systems - Build a model that captures carbon in the most efficient way.
3. Predictive modelling of CO2 storage potential - Build a model that predicts the quantity of carbon to be stored.
4. Optimal carbon storage reservoir management - Deals with the many obstacles of carbon storage to effectively store and make available stored carbon.
5. AI reutilization (Sell it to another end users downstream on the chain) - The transfer of the stored carbon for reuse.
6. Trade Carbon Credits - Platform to trade and buy carbon credits.

Scope:
The project will include an outline solution of the carbon capture cycle. A prototype to show companies of the possibilities that our model can produce. The data we are using to create our model is not production level data and is more to showcase the ability of our model.

Methodology:
We will implement a waterfall approach of handling each step of the model separately and sequentially. We are going to use timelines to appropriately handle each phase in a timely manner for completion. We will have the common 5 phases of our model.

Resources: 
We were supplied a set of data sets and the idea from the carbon capture competition we entered.
We found resources to implement AI algorithms and books from professionals in which we took ideas from.

Risk management: 
The risk is that the solution might be too complex to complete on time, so in order to mitigate this risk we have to follow guidelines.
The data sets given by the competition might be too general, so a specific solution might not be possible.

Benefits: 
The expected benefit outcome of this project is that we will establish a framework solution to the real world problem that is of carbon capture based on an AI solution. We will impact the oil and gas industry by generating a solution they can implement themselves based on the work we do on this project.

Conclusion: 
The carbon offsetting represent critical components in the global effort to combat climate
change, offering pathways to significantly reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. 
However, realizing their full potential requires overcoming substantial technological, economic, and regulatory challenges. By addressing these hurdles through concerted efforts from governments, industries, and the scientific community, CCUS can become a cornerstone in the transition to a low-carbon economy, complementing the shift towards renewable energy sources and broader decarbonization strategies.
